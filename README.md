Simple tool to find your movies in your movie folder and open it.
The tool just work with correkt folder syntax. My mkv files dont have a id3 tag so I just take the information from the folder where the *.mkv files are inside.

Features:

- Find *.mkv files and list it
- Open videos with double click
- Search function

New since 9.6.2013:

- Option page to edit vlc path and movie path

Comming up:

- Just in time search, without search button
- Different movie types, not just *.mkv like now
- Create Excel file with your movies and location of the movies
