Simple tool to find your movies in your movie folder and open it.
The tool just work with correkt folder syntax. My mkv files dont have a id3 tag so I just take the information from the folder where the *.mkv files are inside.

Features:

- Find *.mkv files and list it
- Open videos with double click
- Search function
- Option page to edit vlc path and movie path

New since 12.6.2013:

- Just in time search
- open the searched movie with enter n the search field

Comming up:

- Create Excel file with your movies and location of the movies
- Different movie types, not just *.mkv like now
